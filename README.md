Run these commands in order to get started

# **Linux/Mac:**
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 manage.py runserver

# **Windows:**
    python3 -m venv venv
    ./venv/Scripts/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 manage.py runserver

Note that after you've created your env the first time you shouldn't need to do it again. You'll need to activate it each time you open a new terminal session. And you may occasionally need to rerun the pip3 command if the requirements have changed since the last time you did it.
